Current Working Group Business

draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques/
	Daniel Kahn Gillmor: Glad that it is being coordinated with ACME
		May be an attack where someone is giving you parts to splice together
		All need to be spliced as prefix, or suffix, not both
	John Levine: Looks better since last time
		We have a registry to use underscore tags
		Thinks the PSL won't add flags or tags
			The PSL is just a heuristic
			Erik Nygren: Not needing anything new from the PSL

draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify, Johan Stenstam
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify/
	Erik: If you want it at the zone apex, don't use SVCB unless it uses an underscore name
	Petr: Might need extra parameters
		Such as "talk to me over TLS"
	JohnL: Needs a new RRtype to reduce the security issues instead of SVCB
		Johan: This is for SIG(0), not shared secret
	Jim Reid: Now at the implementation details
		How will the client find out who the parent is?
		Johan: There are algorithms for that
			Already dealing with the problem in other contexts
	Ben Schwartz: Doesn't think this draft needs to talk about transport
		How does this deal with dynamic DNS
		Johan: Wait for Friday
	Peter Thomassen: Can determine in two queries if this is signed
		Could parents use this to publish new records under the same label
	Ray Bellis: Go for a new RRtype
		Maybe stick with SVCB format

For Consideration

draft-many-dnsop-dns-isolated-networks, Marc Blanchet
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-many-dnsop-dns-isolated-networks/
	BenS: Is someone doing that today?
		Marc: Will be happening on the moon, no DNS
			This has additional use cases
		BenS: Wants real operational experience
			Suggests that you don't do DNS in space
	Ralf Weber: Where are the connections terminated?
		Marc: Mostly local
		Ralf: Cries for local infrastructure
	Wes Hardaker: LocalRoot Project already does this type of stuff
		Has done research with this
		Will add link on the LocalRoot site


Friday 2023-11-10 morning

AD report on a document that got dropped from the WG
	draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc5933-bis
	Went to the ISE
	Is that OK?
	(No objection in the room)

For Consideration

draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-ddns, Johan Stenstam
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-ddns/
	Wes: Likes this
		Key distribution, authorization, authentication are still a problem
		Johan: "smaller parents" already have a communication mechanism
			Can just do it once with this key
	Ed Lewis: REGEXT has the same example with EPP
		Operators don't want dynamic update exposed to the public
	Suzanne: Maybe have an interim

Current Working Group Business

draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8109bis, Paul Hoffman
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8109bis/

draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc7958bis, Paul Hoffman
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc7958bis/
	Warren: Can we add another format for the XML file
		Paul: That's up to the WG, IANA will respond
	PeterT: Please be sure the hash is kept in the trust anchor file
		Paul: It is still mandatory

draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence/
	Ed: Explicitly not allowed to query for NSEC3, can do this here
		This is complex to describe
		Needs an applicability statement saying you don't need to do this 
	Christian Elmerot: Cloudflare has made changes in deployment pipeline
		Shumon: Do you treat metatypes special?
		Christian: Yes
	BenS: Doesn't understand the motivation
	 Any reasonable implementation would have a cache
	 This draft does not save any CPU time
	 Is it really worth it for response size?
	 Clarify the text
	 Christian: This does save CPU time at Cloudflare
	 Shumon: Also the packet size
	 Shane: We synthesize on the fly

draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-dane, Ben Schwartz
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-dane/
	This is related to the new DELEG discussion
	Benno: Almost ready for WG Last Call

For Consideration

draft-homburg-dnsop-igadp, Philip Homburg
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-homburg-dnsop-igadp/
	Ed: This sounds like lazy evaluation of zone transfer
		How do you predict which parts to update?
		Philip: Don't do anything special
	Stefan Ubbink: Likes this idea, willing to help
	PeterT: Sounds like a resolver with restricted capability
		Philip: Using that word will be confusing, but is mostly forwarding
	Johan: Likes this
		For large zones, will never use most parts of the zone 
		So, not IXFR, but instead for limited use
	Petr: This is done in BIND for weird reasons today
	Peter Koch: Like an authoritative with a long line to the database
		Why document this protocol?
		Maybe just document the operational aspect

draft-peltan-edns-presentation-format, Libor Peltan
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-peltan-edns-presentation-format/
	Paul: Explained why this was an individual document
	Petr: Original purpose was to help interoperabilty testing
		Good luck
	Jim Reid: If you just want review, send to DNS Directorate
		AD sponsored is a good path forward
	Greg Choules: If there was a much better way to show this, it would help folks understand DNS

draft-momoka-dnsop-3901bis, Momoka Yamamoto
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-momoka-dnsop-3901bis/
	Geoff Huston: Is a heretic in the church of IPv6
		All about fragmentation
		In IPv6, the likelihood of fragments getting lost is very high
		The failure rate for large packets on IPv6 rockets
		Timers in DNS software are longer than TCP timeouts
		This says "I hate users"
		This is irresponsible because we have measured that it will hurt users
		Strikes him as crazy
	Erik Nygren: Thank you for doing this
		Long overdue
	Wes: Strong support for this
		Geoff's concerns are valid but limited
	Ralf: Supports
		Did research about what parts of the DNS is not v6-ready
		New networks are often faster for v6
	Tobias Fiebig: Hears the arguments about MTU
		Problem across all protocol families
	Andrew Fregly: Has been looking at post-quantum signature sizes
		Research should drive the development

Liaison with other WGs

draft-hollenbeck-regext-epp-delete-bcp, Scott Hollenbeck
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hollenbeck-regext-epp-delete-bcp/
	Paul: New mailing list
		We don't deal with dead things well
	Ed: DNS does not recognize operator
		Is not a protocol issue
	PeterT: Get as close as possible to something that is consistent
		Delete things that are dead
	Warren: Doesn't know where it should live
		Maybe another mailing list
		This is an ongoing problem with lots of research
		Work on this quickly
	Scott: Active SSAC work on this

draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap and draft-lenders-dns-cbor, Martine Lenders
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap/
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-lenders-dns-cbor/
	Ed: Is these devices doing their own DNS resolution or use a resolver
		Uses a DoC server
		That server can confirm the source
		A DELEG record can help get from this DNS to that DNS, but will be huge
	BenS: Good to get a review here
		A lot like defining a JSON representation for DNS
		An interesting challenge
