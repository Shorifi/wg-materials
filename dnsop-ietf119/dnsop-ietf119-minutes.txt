Administrivia, Chairs
Opening, Note Well and Blue Sheets
draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline
	How to handle this
	Paul Wouters: The ISE might blackhole this
		It's weird for a WG to say "we don't think this is important, go to the ISE"
	Warren Kumari: Need to think about why to do this
	Paul Hoffman: This specific document feels like the kind of thing that the ISE likes
		It's "here is how .SE does it" is good long-term idea

draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify, Peter Thomassen
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify/
	PaulW: If you sync records related to DNSSEC, the parent should be signed
		DSYNC label could be a DDoS attack
		Would like DNSSEC required
		Peter: Required for CSYNC, maybe not for other methods
	Wes Hardaker: Authoritative servers doing key management now needs to query; worrisome
		Peter: Would have one set of servers that is monitoring and other that might config
		Wes: Still worries about this additon
	Jim Reid: Really likes the idea
		Flashback to earlier discussion of looking for zone cut
		Peter: Would like to learn the history as well
	Johan: The entity that looks up the DSYNC is the child, when it wants to make a change
		Per-child once a year or less
		Has a hard time seeing this as a volumetric attack

draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8109bis, Paul Hoffman
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8109bis/

    Paul mentions that this was pulled back from IESG to WG due to discussion.
    Currently do not deal with status of root zone operators as stated.
    Root zone and root zone operators are special. Mark Andrews to send text.
    If WG agrees to this, will fundamentally change document.
    Willem's email ties into Mark's comments.

    Warren Kumari: Please review this text.

draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc7958bis, Paul Hoffman
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc7958bis/
    Currently IANA has many ways to say the same thing. Removed what authors
    think are historic mechanisms.
    Still open issues.

    Paul Wouters: Relying on transport security?
    PaulH: No, still self-signed version existing.
    George Michaelson: Don't think you are going to get closure on this.
    Lars-Johan Liman: Publishing in many ways is the way.

draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence/
	No mic line
	
draft-ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation, Willem Toorop
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation/
	Ralf Weber: It is technically possible that a fully-DNSSEC-signed server to put you in a bad state
		Keep this implementation-specific
	PaulW: This comes from Unbound
		RHEL did this about 10 years ago, and there were never any problems
		Please do this
	
For Consideration

draft-huque-dnsop-grease, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-huque-dnsop-grease/
	Terry Manderson: Really really likes this approach
		Expect criticism, should go forward
	Lars-Johan Liman: supports this
		Use RIPE Atlas probes
	Peter: TLS greasing causes things to break
		For DNS, you get a picture and measure 
		Can you press bad implementations
		Mark Andrews: We do want pressure them
			We see lots of things for earlier standards that have not been widely adopted because of this
			Couldn't bump the EDNS version when it was improved

DELEG BoF Update, Dave Lawrence
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/deleg/about/
	Summary of what his impressions were
	Thought the BoF went well
	Discussion is happening on dd@ietf.org
	Settling on charter
	Draft authors will continue to develop their draft
	Wes: Also thought it went well
		Active discussion on the charter
		Sooner we finish, the sooner we hand it to Warren
	Warren: Also thought it went very well
		Thought it was going to be more contentious
	Jim: Thanks for getting the BoF set up
		What's the timeline for when the charter will be ready
		Wes: We want to see the discussion happen, then peter down
			No specific timeline
			Will work with Warren on when it is ready for the IESG
			No fixed timeline
	Warren: We want good chairs, so will ask for them
		Doesn't have to be in OPS, but if not, strong coordination is needed
	Tale: Was very encouraged in Prague by the numbers of people interested
		Concerned that we might lose the momentum
	Paul: Will keep the mailing list open to keep up the momentum
	Tale: Éric says that Will take IESG about four weeks 

For Consideration

draft-hardaker-dnsop-rfc8624-bis, Wes Hardaker
draft-hardaker-dnsop-must-not-sha1, Wes Hardaker
draft-hardaker-dnsop-must-not-ecc-gost, Wes Hardaker
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hardaker-dnsop-rfc8624-bis/
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hardaker-dnsop-must-not-sha1/
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hardaker-dnsop-must-not-ecc-gost/
	Mike Bishop: Agrees with the goals
		How often do you expect this to happen?
		If this happens 10 times a year, that's bad
		Wes: New RFCs will short
			Less than yearly changes
	Ray Bellis: New algorithm lifecycles document is coming
		States can be mapped
	Paul: Wants context in the IANA registy to show that this is about implementation, not operations
	Warren: Expecting one a year
		Maybe more for post-quantum algorithms
	Jim: How does this table get updated
		RFCs, particularly standards RFC
	Eliot Lear: Should adopt this draft
		From the ISE perspective, this is fine
		Forsees some possible corner cases where an ISE draft says "remove that old ISE document"
	<< Added draft-huque-dnsop-multi-alg-rules discussion >>
	Daniel Kahn Gilmor: How do we measure universal support
		How can we do timely updates
		Peter: Need to discuss later
	Wes: No strong opinion on this column
		Column can become less useful if someone turns off support
	Warren: Expert reviewer "makes their best guess" for universal support
	Paul: Does not support adoption of draft-hardaker-dnsop-must-not-sha1 until there is better security reasoning

draft-toorop-dnsop-ranking-dns-data, Willem Toorop
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-toorop-dnsop-ranking-dns-data/
	Ben Schwartz: Thinks this is time, but get rid of it
		Ranking was never true
		Willem: Some resolvers do this exactly as listed
	Mark: ZONEMD doesn't change glue
		When everything is signed, we can get rid of this
		Until then, we need ranking because get stale
	Warren: We should do this
		We have seen places where bad implementations have failed
	Daniel: Agrees we need this kind of discussion
		Might discuss that there is no consensus
		There may be contextual information that changes tradeoffs
	Ralf: Local policies always wins
		Could say that there are multiple 
	Jim: Thinks this is good work

draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-ddns and draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify, Johan Stenstam
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-ddns/
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify/
	Mark: BIND already uses TCP for updating PTR records
		At TLDs, can use EPP
	Daniel: Replace "over TCP" use "with IP source verification"
		Might use encrypted transport with authentication
		Johan: Is not being prescriptive, giving examples of mechanisms
	Chat: This is a downgrade from what we are doing
		Johan: Then don't do it
	Ben: Does this increase the usability of DNSSEC
		Johan: Orthoganal to usability
			Will help automation
		Ben: Should have big warnings
	Mark: With this, you can update all the delegation mechanisms
	 Getting a key that the parent accepts has always been the problems
	 Ben: If this makes it easier to sign their zones, it makes it easier for the attacker to do
	Johan: If the parent chooses a policy that is harder than this, fine
		Same for easier
		It doesn't have to be dangerous

draft-ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency, Peter Thomassen
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency/
	Paul: Question about whether whole CDS RRset must match
		Peter: Yes
