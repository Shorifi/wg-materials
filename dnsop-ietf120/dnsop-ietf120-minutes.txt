DNSOP WG
Vancouver, BC, Canada
Session 1
Date: Monday, July 22, 2024
Time: 15:30-17:00 local
Chairs: Benno Overeinder, Suzanne Woolf, Tim Wicinski

Only discussion during the mic line are covered here, not the slides
You should definitely read the slides

Administrivia, Chairs
	Opening, Note Well and Blue Sheets
	Lots of review of the past few months in the slides
	Side meeting on DNS "load balancing" on Wednesday
	Hackathon update: Willem Toorop and Johan Stenstam

Generalized DNS Notifications, Peter Thomassen
	draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify
	Ben Schwartz: Litmus test for SVCB records is whether it is under a URI scheme
		Only useful if you have a URI for the things you want to use
	Ondřej Surý: Confusing to use the word "notify" and "notifications"
	Robert Story: You don't want to send the notify until all your nameservers are in sync
		Maybe set a timer in a record to tell when to revalidate
	Q Misell: No different notifications for CDS and CDNSKEY
		Is it appropriate for a registrar to implement this?
		Peter: how would a registrar announce the endpoint for this?
	Johan Stenstam: Sympathize with with Ondřej's confusion
		This is a new use case, keep with the NOTIFY name
		Child has no way to know when a parental scan will happen, so scan now
	Matt Pounsett: Break the assumption of about NOTIFY
		SVCB is not appropriate without doing new stuff

Automating DNS Delegation Management via DDNS, Johan Stenstam
	draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-ddns
	Ondřej: Wanted to deprecate SIG(0)
		Johan: We really like it
	Paul Hoffman: What is the KSK you talked about?
		Johan: It is the same 
	Ted Lemon: Can't get of SIG(0)

Delegation Revalidation by DNS Resolvers, Willem Toorop
	draft-ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation
	Ben Schwartz: If resolver doesn't block responding, what is the security advantage?
		Willem: After the first response
		Ben: Are there deployed resovers with strict resolver security?
		Willem: Maybe RHEL
		Ben: Wants to be cautious about security claims
	Ondřej: Document is underspecified for when you get no nameservers
		More on error conditions
	Robert: Would like more description of the rankings
		Maybe new terminology
	Mark Andrews: A lot of things broke when they turned this on
		Needs to get Google and other public resolvers and fail fully when child records don't match
		Willem: Some places in DNS namespace are more resilient, still work to do
	Jim Reid: Mark's idea is unrealistic, non-starter

Secure Nameserver Selection Algorithm for DNS Resolvers, Fenglu Zhang
	draft-zhang-dnsop-ns-selection
	Ondřej: Purpose of multiple nameservers is not balancing, but resilience
		Language of the draft is overly agressive, tone it down
		Disagrees with the vulnerabilities in BIND
		Based on wrong premise
		Fenglu: About 3% of nameservers are non-responsive
			Was imprecise about BIND9 status for some things in the draft
	Ben: A lot of these issues are inappropriate for IETF draft
		The one that seems closed to this is the disabling attack
		Question about what constitutes a vulnerability
		Think carefully about what the promises that are being made
	Benno: Ask an implementer about the next draft
	
Session 2
Date: Thursday, July 25, 2024
Time: 18:30-19:30 local
Chairs: Benno Overeinder, Suzanne Woolf, Tim Wicinski

464 Customer-side Translator (CLAT): Node Recommendations, Tommy Jensen
	draft-link-v6ops-claton
	Warren: Can we be creative with the wording in 7050
	Jen Linkova: Would like 7050 to disappear
		Send clear message with MUST NOT
	Ben: SHOULD but we know you won't
		Can change the examples
		But if nobody does this, we should reflect reality
		Validating stub resol
	Mark: The text does not say what the secure channel is
		DNS64 will change the AAAA records because it breaks DNSSEC
		Make DNS64 obsolete
	David Schinazi: Has implemented RFC 7050
		There are cases where you need to use NAT64 directly for happy eyeballs
		Deprecate 7050 and DNS64
	Lorenzo Colitti: This is not a good mechanism
		It would be nice of 7050 goes away, not using prefs option
		Tommy: We should be honest
		Could update 7050 to point out that most links are already encrypted
	Nick Buraglio: Deprecating this would not preclude anything that exists
		Sends a message because this is the modern way to do it
		Better from an operator perspective
	Warren: Everbody is doing this
		We don't have to keep DNS64, and say why
	Jen: In V6OPS WG, they already have a document to deprecate
		Good to say "don't use this because it is obsolete"

DNS based load balancing (a.k.a. GeoDNS, GSLB) side meeting summary, Ben Schwartz
	Will need a name for the mailing list
	Should we be thinking in terms internal to nameservers, or the protocols talking between the parties

Client Authentication Recommendations for Encrypted DNS, Tommy Jensen
	draft-tjjk-cared
	Warren: Comcast can say "please fill in this form to get access to our resolver"
		Tommy: This would be inappropriate
			Would be willing to write why this is bad
		Why not do this in ADD?
		Tommy: ADD is for discovering server properties
	Tobias Fiebig: The connection must be very explicit
		Tommy: Does not want to be over-inclusive
	Wes: Likes the guidance; it is super-critical
		Knowing whether you expect to authenticate is important
		If you can spell it out to say "managed devices", that would be better
	Ben: Agrees with substantitive content of the draft, horrified by everything else
		We are not empowered to tell people "of the things that can work together, don't use these two"
		We can give a list of implications, don't require a specific protocol
		Maybe can use Privacy Pass for this
		Doesn't like the normative language
		Tommy: We don't say "shouldn't do anything else"
		Talk about the properties, don't do a survey
	Jim: Great piece of work, should be adopted in DNSOP
		No one else is the right home
	Joe: Agrees with Jim
		Volunteers to help
		Interop is important, annoying if everyone does it their own way
		Bad if you get this wrong
		Defending the user of devices, preventing privacy leaking everywhere
	Jessica Krynitsky: Like the energy and hate of what it is worded
		Agrees with the idea of enumerating properties
	Erik Nygren: Will help interop
		Warn people about the shart edges
	Q: Good informational document
		Might have reasons to run something else
	Warren: Corporate resolvers horrifies us
		Interoperability is good; we should document this
		Is not clear if this is in the charter
		Wants a poll: more "yes" than "no", equal number of "no opinion"
	
Zone Hopping: A method to prevent zone-walking in DNSSEC, Fatema Bannat Wala
	draft-fbw-dnsop-dnszonehop
	Joe: Aggressive NSEC caching
		Stopped zone walking, but also stops resolution in the real world
		Fatema: Interested in the drawbacks
	Ondřej: Horrible idea, wearing a developer's hat
		DNS deployment has a long tail, it will take years
		Will not implement this
	Evan Hunt: Same remark as NSEC5
		Zone walking is not a problem
		Don't need another solution
		Waste of WG time for something that is not a problem
	Q: There is no such thing as a senstive DNS name
