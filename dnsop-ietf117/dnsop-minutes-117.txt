	Lots of stuff on the chair slides

Current drafts

draft-ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency, Peter Thomassen
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency/
	Johan Stenstam: Doesn't like the CSYNC stuff
		This is changing the the definition of what "correct" means
		Had a related problem for .se about 15 years ago
		Dangerous to have a system where you need agreement from all of them
		Peter: Not questioning validation of signatures
	Ed Lewis: Doesn't like silent fail
		Hard for operations
		Peter: Wants registries for some kind of reporting
	Warren noted about the wireless issues in the room 
	Wes Hardaker: These are all hard problems
		Wrote CSYNC to help folks update their parents
		Having these types of capabilities is important, but maybe we need to start over
	Mark Andrews: Wants multisigner to be safe
		To do that we need multiple inputs
		Is willing to do manual recovery if a server is dead
		DNS is loosely coherent
	

draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence/
	Viktor Dukhovni:
		We should only standardize with ENT, not NXDOMAIN
			NXDOMAIN causes a conflict
	Dave Lawrence: Wants both signals, but if we only have one, wants NXDOMAIN
	Jim Reid: Will you have two meta RRtypes?
		Shumon: Yes
	Christian Elmerot:
		Wants NXDOMAIN RRtype more than ENT
		Is doing NXDOMAIN, also has code for ENT case
	Ed: This disagrees with RFC 4035
		Rationale is that the signed and unsigned be coherent
		Maybe create a different RRtype, don't overload NSEC
		Don't upend original work
	Paul Hoffman: Don't register in IANA until the document is stable
	David: Wants to recommend things with guidance
		Resolver should be able to indicate that they understand this
		Shumon: It can be deployed

Possible future work

draft-bash-rfc7958bis, Paul Hoffman
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bash-rfc7958bis/
	Tim: Wants to see it adopted

draft-bellis-dnsop-qdcount-is-one, Ray Bellis
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bellis-dnsop-qdcount-is-one/
	Warren: Why QDCOUNT of 0?
		Ray: DNS cookies have it
	Peter Thomassen: Why are we solving this?
		Ray: Don't want it on the public internet
	Ted Lemon: Wants the document to be smaller
		OpenThread (IoT thing used in Matter) DNSSD client uses QDCOUNT=2 for two RRtypes
		Different nameservers give different responses to QDCOUNT=2
		Should say "don't do this" and "what should you do if you get such a query"
		Maybe document that there are implementations
	Mark: BIND9 returns FORMERR without the question
	Lars-Johan Liman: Why do we need to define this?
		If you send a query with QDCOUNT > 1, it's your problem to deal with it
		Ray: Wants to prevent this for different corner cases
		Ted: It is not possible to be well-defined
	Jim: Should say "don't do this" but not "what should you do if you get such a query" 
		Make the background as an informational RFC
		Ray: has some of this in another draft

draft-grubto-dnsop-dns-out-of-protocol-signalling, Willem Toorop
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-grubto-dnsop-dns-out-of-protocol-signalling/
	Ben Schwartz: Why is this specific to DNS?
		Willem: It is not specific to DNS
			There are some conditions that can be noticed within the nameserver
		Ben: Should be a specification closer to BGP, and then a BCP closer to DNS
	Ray: Can't necessarily hand off directly to the BGP daemon

draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline, Johan Stenstam
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline/

draft-thomassen-dnsop-generalized-dns-notify, Johan Stenstam
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomassen-dnsop-generalized-dns-notify/
	Warren: This was floated when the original docs but was considered a DoS vector
		Johan: Doesn't think it is a major issue
			Important thing is to be able to tell the parent before a full scan
	Ed: Event-driven is more elegant than polling
		Wants to see polling fail before we adopt this
	John Levine: Thinks this is a good idea
		You have to poll either regularly or when prompted to
		Take out the new RRtype

draft-dnsop-multi-alg-rules, Peter Thomassen
	https://github.com/shuque/draft-dnsop-multi-alg-rules
	Ed: Needs to be solved
		Don't have metadata now, and this would cause metadata in the configuration
	Sam Weiler: Takes the signalling out of band
		What if you were to define a new algorithm number such as 8 or 13
	Ben: Thinks he wants the opposite of this
		Wrote "DNSSEC strict mode", still wants that
		Maybe write something that causes immutable algorithm numbers
