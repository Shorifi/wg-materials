Administrivia, Chairs
    Opening, Note Well and Blue Sheets
    Lots of review of the past few months in the slides
    Hackathon results ??????

draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify, Peter Thomassen
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify/
    See slides

Domain Control Validation using DNS, Shivan Sahib
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques/
    Ben Schwartz: Used in places where it is not the right approach
        This is a kind of weird thing to want
        Instead it's the other way around: Hey domain name, is this user associated with it?
        Thinks text about this is buried in the security considerations
        Shivan: Is this a point-in-time check, or long-term? (Point-in-time)
        Shumon Huque: Agrees that moving this section up is good
            Is good to categorize applications that do DCV
            Not good for long term
        Ben: Provide good guidance earlier in the doc
        Shumon: Can reorganize the doc to make it more readable
            Helped get ACME to make improvements that are in play

DNSSEC Cryptographic Algorithm Recommendation Update Process, Wes Hardaker
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8624-bis/
    Daniel Kahn Gillmor: Doesn't like using RECOMMENDED because this doesn't help administrator pick one
        Wes: Didn't want to get into the discussion of what is the one to do
    Jim Reid: What is the distinction between implementing and using
        Wes: Implementers write code, users use
    Tommy Jensen: Doesn't want the implementation column to have a too-narrow list
    Mike St Johns: Should instead talk about publication side versus client side
        Wes: Send text to help make the distinction

DNS IPv6 Transport Operational Guidelines, Momoka Yamamoto and Tobias Fiebig
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-momoka-dnsop-3901bis/
    Wes: In v6, you can't figure out what's broken
        This is a bigger problem than just the DNS
        Geoff Huston wants to fix v6
        How will I even be able to detect the problem?
        We're stuck in the middle
    Èric Vynke: Would love to have this document
        Be more careful of when you cannot follow the SHOULD
        The IANA considerations is only about IANA zones, not good
    Tommy: Likes this, OK with splitting out
        We need to work on this, is willing to help
    Eric Nygren: Important work for us to do
        No going back, documenting what to fix is important
        Keep focus on v6, do transport later
    Ben: Do transport later
    Mark Andrews: BIND has ways to resolve across v4 or v6 islands
        BIND already has a v6 bias
        The bias is useful
        Handles fragmentation since 1999
    Paul Hoffman: Is this the right WG for this?
        But after hearing Mark, maybe the developers have enough expertise


Secret Key Agreement for DNS: The TKEY Resource Record
Domain Name System (DNS) Public Key Based Request and Transaction Authentication ( SIG(0) )
Donald Eastlake
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-eastlake-dnsop-rfc2930bis-tkey/
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-eastlake-dnsop-rfc2931bis-sigzero/
    Petr Špaček: What is the use case for ECDH TSIG?
        Don: Suggested by Mark Andrews
        Petr: Maybe toss it out
            Sees a use case for SIG0
    Johan Stenstam: Wants to keep some sort of mechanism to do asymmetric signing
        Would not mind a new record type that


Deprecation of DNS64 for Discovery of IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis, Nick Buraglio
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-buraglio-deprecate7050/
    Jen Linkova: 7050 won't work in multihoming
        Would like to see this adopted
    Lorenzo Colitti: Would like to do this
        Have you asked the mobile operators why they do this?
        Maybe not realistic
        Nick: Maybe say "non-mobile environments"
    Tommy: Will not update his earlier draft, this is a better draft
    Èric: Likes this
        Nick: Not saying remove the old ones
    Lorenzo: Talk to mobile operators, maybe drop the old stuff


Session 2
Date: THursday, November 7, 2024
Time: 1730-1830 local
Chairs: Benno Overeinder, Suzanne Woolf, Tim Wicinski

Minutes by Paul Hoffman

Integration of DNS Domain Names into Application Environments: Motivations and Considerations, Andrew Kaizer
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-sheth-dns-integration/
    Paul: Supports adoption
        Likes the parts about name lifecycle
    Wes Hardaker: Likes the draft
        Has a student looking at it
        If we don't explain how to do things properly, we won't be helping them
    Andrew Campling: Respecting DNS settings on the end point
        Wants our experience used

Addition of Extended DNS Errors codes, Stéphane Bortzmeyer
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bortzmeyer-more-edes/
    Warren: Don't see much value in LocalRoot
        Discussion in the IESG about using Internet Draft, he thinks it's fine
    Wes: Original RFC talked about generic or specific
        Ended up with first-come-first-served
        Good for guidance to come, good practice
    Peter van Dijk: Response size are important
    Roy Arends: It is fine to reference drafts
        Pick a generic code point
        IANA uses some discretion on the registry
        WG is busy, doesn't need to be a WG draft, ask your peers
    Petr: As an implementer, would talk to other implementers before he would use
        So talk to other implementers
    Puneet Sood: Maybe start with private use
        ECS EDE: how is this providing information?
    Gianpaolo Scalone: Be more generic so the customers can understand better

A Top-level Domain for Private Use, Kim Davies
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davies-internal-tld/
    Mark Andrews: Would like it in the root giving NXDOMAIN
        Resolvers need to add negative trust anchors if they are validating
        Would have done this for .onion
    Petr: Want a special use registration
    Jim Reid: Should not be registered
        IETF should keep away from these names
    Andrew: Which RFC track?
        Maybe ISE
        Kim: Mostly to bring awareness
    Lars-Johan Liman: Thank you for documenting it
        Wants more content
        What root servers and others to know what to do with it
        Might even be a BCP
        Wants it handled in the IETF
    Duane Wessels: Should be a special-use domain name
        Weird that this one would be different than local
    Warren: IANA did not fail at what they were asked
    Suzanne: The WG needs to decide whether it would benefit the discussion
    Liman: Wants a BCP to give it more weight

Upper limit values for DNS, Kazunori Fujiwara
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-dns-upper-limit-values/
    Roy: First document the limits we already know before suggesting new limits
        Ask developers
    Tobias Fiebig: Caution about upper limits
        Limits of SPF of maximum number of lookups were overrun by reality
            Says 10, really 20 is needed
        Has data to show
    Stéphane: Agrees with numerical limits
        Doesn't agree on non-numerical limits because they are unrelated
    Puneet: Agees with the idea, but also has caution about the cycle of having to update the limits
        Maybe not an RFC
    Petr: Thinks the name server is in scope
    Ondrej: It is useful to have an RFC to help support their decisions in their implementation
        Doesn't think it is so important to update
        Good to have it listed somewhere
    Wes: We need to have a conversation about each of these
        Supports this as a BCP as how to implement on Internet
        DNS is also used other places
        Future-proofing is a problem
